_Javascript/Typescript wrapper for the FiveM ESX Framework natives._

Features based on the [**ESX framework for FiveM**](https://esx-org.github.io/). This module will allow you to fully exploit ESX from your JavaScript/TypeScript developments
## Features

- Two dependencies [@citizenfx/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@citizenfx/client) and [fivem-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fivem-js)
- Integration of ESX Class (and functions) client and server side

In other words, whatever the FiveM ESX Lua Framework wrapper can do, this package can as well.

_Note: Not all features are currently available. They will be added as development continues as well as additional language specific features._
